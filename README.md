# XPower Token UI

The XPower token (XPOW) user interface allows you to *mine* for random nonces and to then *mint* for the corresponding amounts. It runs in a modern browser and expects the [Metamask] extension (or add-on) to be available.

[Metamask]: https://metamask.io/

## Installation

```shell
npm install
```

## Development

### Lint

```shell
npm run -- lint [--fix]
```

### Build

```shell
npm run build
```

### Watch

```shell
npm run watch
```

### Test

```shell
npm test
```

## Server

### Start local server with

```shell
npm start
```

#### ..or with the DEBUG flag set

```shell
npm run debug
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`, connect your Metamask and start mining for tokens. Once a valid nonce is found, you can then mint XPOW tokens for the corresponding amount.

## User Interface

### Query Parameters

Name | Type | Default | Description
-----|------|---------|------------
clear | boolean | false | flag to clear current persistence slot (as defined by persist flag)
clear-all | boolean | false | flag to clear all persistence slots
logger | boolean | false | flag to log nonces to console
min-level | number | 5 | threshold of nonces with lower corresponding amounts to be ignored
max-level | number | 64 | threshold of nonces with higher corresponding amounts to be ignored
persist | number | 0 | flag to persist nonces; each non-zero value is a separate persistence slot
speed | number | 50 | speed percentage (w.r.t a single browser tab) between 0 and 100

### Examples

To ignore (frequent & low-value) nonces with an amount less than 5 CPU tokens and mine with a speed of 100% use:

```
http://localhost:3000?min-level=5&speed=100
```

To persist nonces between reloads at 1st slot use (may impact mining performance):

```
http://localhost:3000?persist=1
```

To clear (i.e. forget) persisted nonces at 1st slot use:

```
http://localhost:3000?persist=1&clear=true
```

To clear (i.e. forget) all persisted nonces use:

```
http://localhost:3000?clear-all=true
```

To log nonces to console use (may impact mining performance):

```
http://localhost:3000?logger=true
```

> **Note:** All non-minted nonces are cleared at the start of each interval (i.e. every hour), independent of the flags above! Further, (reloaded) nonces cannot be minted once the interval (i.e. hour), at which they have been mined, expires.
